    <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Adonis Program</h2>
    <p class="blog-post-meta">February 1, 2018 by <a href="mailto:brad.lee.jest@gmail.com">Brad</a></p>

    <p>The Adonis program is a flexible, and effective system to develop a healthy, and great looking body. Its usable everywhere from just doing the exercises to learning about everything that goes into a killer program (biology, physiology, psychology, chemistry, sociology etc). This website takes the original Adonis Index content and streamlines everything it can so that you just have to do the workouts and record the data to take advantage of decades of experience and research from professional. This program covers everything from letting you know what your goals realistically should be, to letting you know just how to progress in that direction, to an easy method to record and see your progress bit by bit.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>This Adonis program is one of the most effective workout systems to develop a healthy, great looking body. The best part is that it's been time tested, its simple, and easy to start. We want to meet your needs wherever they are, if you just want to jump in and trust that we know what you should do, you can start now by logging on and click "<a href="/workouts">Start a Workout</a>". Or if you want to know as much as possible about this program, we have everything you could want to know in the "<a href="/reading">Reading</a>" section.  </p>
    
    <h2>What you need</h2>
    <p>So may need a couple things depending on how you want to do this. If you have a gym membership you have most of what you need right there. If it is a decent gym it will have all the machines and weights you'll need and then some. If you are doing this from home you'll need whatever equipment the workouts require, most importantly dumbbells, a workout bench, and a bar.</p>

    <p>Additionally you may need/want a scale to measure changes in weight, a mylo tape to measure proportions (<a href="/_THE_THEORY_OF_IDEAL_BODY_PROPORTIONS_AGR.pdf">Adonis Index</a>), and some supplements depending on your personal goals. You'll find more information on supplements in the "<a href="/reading">Reading</a>" section.</a></p>

    <h3>The Indexer</h3>
    <p>One of the Adonis Programs unique features is that it has a standard on what the best body type appearance is. There is a ton of science and trial and error that goes into what that actual standard is and how they got there, but we'll let you read about that in the "<a href="/_THE_THEORY_OF_IDEAL_BODY_PROPORTIONS_AGR.pdf">THE THEORY OF THE IDEAL BODY PROPORTIONS</a>."</p>
    
    <p>If you log on, and use the Indexer it will calculate your Ideal Proportions, what your current ratio is and how close you are to the Golden Ratio. It will also add a time stamp so you can track your progress over time. Lots of people quit working out because it "not working." Sometimes they really aren't, but often its just because they aren't looking in the right places. Weight is one indicator of success, so is increased capacity to use heavier weights, or exercise more frequently. But one that many people miss is your body proportions. You'll most likely lose some weight, but also gain some back in muscle, which may seem like you aren't having any effect, but muscles are denser than fat and your proportions won't lie.</p>

    <h3>The Data Section</h3>
    <p>We also have a robust data system designed to give you pertinent information in the most accessible way possible. As you record your workouts and regularly use the Indexer you'll be able to see how often you workout, the average weight you lift by exercise, max scores, and your progress towards the Golden Ratio. In the past you'd need to check back and forth on paper to see what you did last time, and what you should be aiming for. Now it's all in one place.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-title">Why I made this Website</h2>

    <p>I've used this program a couple times in my life and had good results. But I recently took a new hobby. Programming. I realized I didn't need to carry around a clipboard and pen, with a mess of papers in my duffel bag. I just needed a website designed to streamline an already excellent workout program. So I made this site. It's a work in progress, and it's really only meant for me, but I hope other people can take advantage of the work I have done (on top of the fantastic Adonis Index Program) and get excellent results. If you have any feedback or ideas on how to improve this website, let me know and send me an email.</p>
